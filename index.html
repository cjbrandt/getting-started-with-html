          <b>Basic parts of the web</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The web is an enormous network
          of computers that communicate 
          with each other. The <em>user</em> accesses 
          the web through a computer 
          with a <em>web browser</em>. 
          Through the <em>internet</em> 
          the browser is able to obtain html
          documents from various <em> servers</em> 
          using <em>http</em>. Those documents 
          are then interpreted by the browser
          and displayed to the user in the 
          manner which the programmers intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>HTML</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is an acronym for HyperText
          Markup Language. It is the basis 
          for everything on the web. HTML is 
          made up of <em>text content</em>, 
          which is "what you see" and 
          <em>markup</em>, which is "how it
          looks."
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>HTML attributes - elements/tags</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents consist of <em>elements</em>,
          which include various <em>tags</em> that tell 
          the browser how to display the document.
        </p>

          <b>Computers are stupid</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        Programmers like to say that computers are stupid
        because they do not think for themselves. They do
        exactly as they are told. So, any little typo or other
        minor error can cause a computer to fail to carry
        out the program. On the other hand, because they
        do exactly as commanded, this gives programmers a
        lot of power if they understand how to correctly 
        provide the necessary commands.

          <b>Inline and block elements</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an important distinction to be made
          between inline elements and block elements. 
          Simply put, block elements construct an 
          invisible box around the text, allowing it 
          to be altered in various other ways. For more
